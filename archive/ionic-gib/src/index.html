  <meta name="description" content="Web3 Minimum Viable Prototype for the ibgib protocol. The app contains local functionality like a wiki for note taking/mind map, as wlel as todo features as well. All data is built in Merkle DAG substrate (with cryptographic hashing) that is stored locally in browser. Synchronization across spaces (e.g. cloud)  user-defined enables distributed collaboration, like a chat, with each object itself having its own git/vcs-like timeline. Branches can be merged like in git/vcs, with on-DAG data-as-code transforms instead of text-diffs, effecting a CRDT-style DAG growing mechanism. Each app is itself one of these data-as-code ibgibs. Also has some chatbot functionality, with each both also being its own ibgib graph projection.">
