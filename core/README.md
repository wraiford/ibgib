# ibgib

This is the core part of the ibgib engine, written in TypeScript.
This is responsible for creating quantum ibgib frames based on
existing ibgib quanta.

### to add unit tests (specs)

Add a file in the same folder as the one you want to test.
Copy the filename and add .spec just before the extension,
e.g. src/folder/file-here.ts -> src/folder/file-here.spec.ts

## questions

### what is an ibgib?

Answering what an ibgib is about answering what "is" is. So there are
many ways to think of it...

### attention and devil's advocate

Think of the dynamic between our brain's process of "attention" and
the possibility of "playing devil's advocate". Essentially, you can
either point your attention at some "thing" where you think of
extending that same thing over time, or you can think of "splitting"
that thing and considering the result to be some "new" thing.

But each of these actions (and other permutations and actions not listed)
itself can be one of those "things". So you can devolve and never extend
anything, where everything is essentially meaningless. Or you can
go the other way and say how everything is still the same (one) thing.

But we experience time as a combination of these two options.

### semantic version control system

Computer people usually think of version control systems like
git, OpenCVS, subversion, etc. These usually borrow jargon from
the evolution of a river or a plant through time, e.g. branching,
forking, root. But these were developed with source control specifically
in mind, and they have been hyper-optimized for dealing with text.
Git has added on non-textual functionality, but it was an afterthought.

ibgib has been made as a self-referencing, bootstrapping semantic
version control system, and more fundamentally, the protocol that
underlies this system. By this, all configuration, source code,
issue tracking, etc., can be stored _inside_ the ibgib data
structures and using ibgib nodal exchanges.

You can think of the data structure as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG),
but this is only at the physical level **and does not capture
the cyclic nature of the ability for ibgibs over time to be
self-referencing** _(and self-negating and other self-thingies)_.

Two of the big focus points are:
1) Each datum is from some perspective, i.e. it's a belief held by an identity.
2) Each datum has context where it is "true" and where it is "false", which actually
defines what these terms mean.

Truth/falseness is determined by the attention on a thing, i.e. wherever
the ibgibs that continue to evolve and persist, those are said to be
"true within that context". Each context itself can be an ibgib, and
this framework provides an addressing scheme/space for this process of attention
that streamlines interaction between microservices/systems, ais, humans,
multi-human organizations, etc. It also does a lot of other stuff.

Ibgibs are also mobile, and can move among contexts proactively,
in addition to the contexts themselves changing over time.

### goedelian numbers counting to infinity

For the even more abstract out there (can't imagine many here on Earth): Each ibgib
datum is a goedelian number. The `ib^gib` (content) address ends up being this number,
and what we are actually doing is counting through time to infinity. But things
"at" infinity act differently than in the finite world.

When you "add" a number, the number was already there from some other context. This
stems from the existence of one infinity not only implies but requires _all infinities_
"to exist". But we experience this process over time. So it also requires that
_all infinities_ "do NOT exist".

Remember the aforementioned attention? This is where we resolve the issue of seemingly
self-negating statements, e.g., "This statement is false." If you think of this naively
with the dead concept of true/false, then you run into a problem. Most scientists and
mathematicians dislike this, just as they dislike most quantum outcomes - a feeling
which manifests itself as these effects being "weird". But back to the attention.

"Both" pathways through a self-negating statement are "true" in some context,
and as such when you are also in "that" context, you will attend to that pathway.
You will provide more time to it _within you yourself as a context_.

Just as you have competing thoughts and emotions (terms which are much more
easily understood with the concept of ibgib) within yourself which can seem to be
diametrically opposed, so any statement can be. This can lead to understanding the
difficulties with current friction between, e.g., pure and applied mathematicians.
Context for "proofs" is absolutely paramount: Under this condition X,Y,Z using these
axioms, etc. But neither axioms, nor their corollaries or proofs, are "true"
absolutely. If you agree with this, then it is true within your context. On down
the road of your life, when you disagree with this, it is false within your context.
Etc...

Enough typing for now, back to coding. Feel free (future and past beings), jump in with
