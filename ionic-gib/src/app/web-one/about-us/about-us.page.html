            Hi, I'm Bill Raiford. I love all living things; each a single thread
            woven into the one tapestry of life; each a single melody in the one
            universal symphony; each a single cell in the one body that
            overcomes entropy.
          </p>
          <p>
            I don't necessarily <i>like</i> all living things.
          </p>
          <p>
            I conceived ibgib well over twenty years ago when I first moved from
            information based on knowledge to that based on belief. Although
            perhaps the first remembrance of this I have is as an 8th grade math
            nerd, I realized that if I ever were to make an "error" that I then
            had a non-zero probability of any statement I made to contain that
            error. This was seemingly quite inescapable!
          </p>
          <p>
            And I could not - and still cannot - read philosophy.
          </p>
          <p>
            So I wrote, and continue to write, code instead, focused on this
            belief-based approach, which over the years has gone through several
            iterations, the most recent prototype of which you are currently
            sampling. As it turns out, instilling humility and belief into a
            code base at its foundations ends up looking extremely biological.
          </p>
          <p>
            So if you're interested in the intersection of non-Shannon,
            belief-based computer science and biological coding; where data and
            metadata sit alongside each other; where theorems are more theorem-y
            and less proof-y; and where we can perhaps gain insight into other
            seemingly disparate topics such as money, knowledge, life &
            death...to you I say welcome!
          </p>
          <p>
            Let us weave our threads, harmonize our melodies, and enjoin our
            bodies as we strive to overcome that entropic night.
          </p>
